# Simple Notes App

We are going to create a simple note application that performs create, read, update and delete operation. We are going to use aws-serverless feature for this.

And for infrastructure as code, we are going to use `serverless` framework and `cloudformation`.

So lets install our node version `16.14.0` (which will be used to build this project).

```bash
nvm install 14.16.0
nvm use 14.16.0
node --version
npm install -g serverless@2
serverless --version
```

so our node version is:  `14.16.0` and serverless framework version: `2.72.3`

now lets create a user with `administrator access` (`admin group`) and create an acess for `cli`.

Now from the official [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) website, we go through the documenation to get the command for `AWS - Config Credentials` which will setup our default cli credential for aws.

```bash
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <access_key> --secret <access_secret>
```

Now lets create a aws-nodejs serverless project from template,

```bash
serverless create -t aws-nodejs
```
